        This integration forwards Sensu Event data to a [Splunk Universal Forwarder] (recommended) or directly to a Splunk indexer.

        NOTE: If Splunk Universal Forwarders are installed directly on the Sensu Backend nodes (or K8s pods), use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the host name.

        You have successfully enabled the "splunk-events" pipeline.

        Checks configured with the `splunk-events` pipeline will send Sensu event and metric data to tcp://[[ host ]]:[[ port ]].

        ```yaml
        spec:
          pipelines:
            - api_version: core/v2
              type: Pipeline
              name: splunk-events
        ```
