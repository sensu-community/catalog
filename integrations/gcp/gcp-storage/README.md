## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The [GCP Storage] monitoring integration collects GCP Storage metrics from [GCP Monitoring API], and alerts on various conditions.

[GCP Monitoring API]: https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following resources:

* `gcp-storage-metrics` [check]
* `sensu/gcp-monitoring-check:0.2.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. This integration requires access to GCP Monitoring API.

   All forms of GCP [authentication supported] by the [GCP Monitoring API] are supported for this integration, including [service account credentials]. This integration requires read-only access to the [GCP Monitoring API].

   Note: Explicit authentication settings are unneeded in this integration if the check(s) are run on a `sensu-agent` installed on an GCP compute instance using a service account with an IAM Profile with necessary API read permissions.
   `sensu-agents` run on GCP compute instances will have their environments pre-populated with service account credentials if available.

[service account credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production
[authentication supported]: https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/enable-api#authorizing-api-v3
