## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Wavefront Metrics integration sends collected metric data to Wavefront for storage and visualization.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following resources:

* `wavefront-metrics` [pipeline]
* `wavefront-metrics` [handler]
* `sensu/sensu-wavefront-handler:0.1.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

There are no compatible dashboards for this integration.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Set up a Wavefront Proxy

    A Wavefront proxy ingests metrics and forwards them to the Wavefront service in a secure, fast, and reliable manner. After you install a proxy in your environment, it can handle thousands of simultaneous clients. With this integration, Sensu Go will send data to the proxy, which consolidates points into configurable batches and sends the data to the Wavefront service.

    Please refer to the [Wavefront proxy documentation](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_installing.html) for the installation steps.

    You will need the proxy **host** address and listening **port** when configuring this integration.

## Metrics & Events

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

This integration does not produce specific [metrics]; it provides an observability [pipeline] for sending metrics, collected by other integrations, to Wavefront.

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

<!-- This integration provides an alert & incident management processing pipeline for use with other monitoring integrations. By default this integration will process all events passing the [built-in `is_incident` filter][is_incident] (i.e. failing events and resolution events only). Event processing via this integration may be suppressed using [Sensu Silencing][silences] (see the [built-in `not_silenced` filter][not_silenced] for more details). -->

This integration does not produce any events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline].

## Reference Documentation

<!-- Please provide links to any relevant reference documentation to help users learn more and/or troubleshoot this integration; specifically including any third-party software documentation. -->
