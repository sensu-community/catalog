## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Sensu backend monitoring integration provides a health checks for ensuring that Sensu backend services are healthy.
Sensu backend services include Postgres, Etcd (coming soon), cluster alarms, and more.
The Sensu backend monitoring integration leverages the [Sensu Health API].

This integration is designed for use in federated Sensu environments where Sensu backend health monitoring is performed by a peer Sensu deployment.

> **What's monitoring your monitoring?**
>
> It's a riddle as old as time.
> The popular conscensus is that the answer cannot be "your monitoring".
> Redundancies are your friend.
> Having said that, this integration _can_ be used in standalone Sensu pre-production environments but should not be relied upon in standalone production environments.
> YMMV. ðŸ˜Š

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Optionally configure the `sensu_backend_health_url` annotation to override the default URL.

   A default Sensu backend URL will be configured via the integration prompts, but individual agents can override this URL by setting the `sensu_backend_health_url` entity annotation.

   Example `agent.yml`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   annotations:
     sensu_backend_health_url: https://sensu.mycompany.com:8080/health
   ```
