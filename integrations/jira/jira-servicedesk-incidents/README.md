## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Jira Service Management integration is a Sensu Event Pipeline that generates alerts in the Jira Service Management service.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration provides the following resources:

* `jira-servicedesk-pipeline` [pipeline]
* `jira-servicedesk-workflow` [workflow]
* `jira-servicedesk-handler` [handler]
* `jira_api_key` [secret]
* `sensu/sensu-jira-handler:2.0.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of supported dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

This integration is compatible with the Jira Service Management dashboard. The Incidents dashboard will display the Sensu Event namespace, entity, and check details (including check status).

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. **Get a Jira Service Management Integration Key**

   While the on-premise version of Jira uses basic HTTP authentication with only
   a simple username and password the [cloud version requires the use of an API
   token to authenticate][10]. To create the API token perform the following steps:

   1. Navigate to [Atlassian's API Tokens Screen][jira-integration-key]
   1. Click on the `Create API Token` button
   1. In the popup box enter `Sensu Jira Handler` or any label of your liking
   1. Click on the `Create` button
   1. Click on `Copy to clipboard` to copy your token

1. **Add the Jira Service Management Integration Key to your secrets provider**

   Create an environment variable or Hashicorp Vault secret for the Jira Service Management Integration Key.

## Metrics & Events

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

This integration does not produce any [metrics].

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

This integration provides an alert & incident management processing pipeline for use with other monitoring integrations. By default this integration will process all events passing the [built-in `is_incident` filter][is_incident] (i.e. failing events and resolution events only). Event processing via this integration may be suppressed using [Sensu Silencing][silences] (see the [built-in `not_silenced` filter][not_silenced] for more details).

This integration does not produce any events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [handler].
