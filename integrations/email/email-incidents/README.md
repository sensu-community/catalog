## Metrics & Events

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

This integration does not produce any [metrics].

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

This integration provides an alert processing pipeline for use with other monitoring integrations. By default this integration will process all events passing the [built-in `is_incident` filter][is_incident] (i.e. failing events and resolution events only). Event processing via this integration may be suppressed using [Sensu Silencing][silences] (see the [built-in `not_silenced` filter][not_silenced] for more details).
