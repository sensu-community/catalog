## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Envoy Metrics integration collects metrics from hosts running [Envoy] and outputs the metrics in Prometheus format.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `envoy-metrics` [check]
* `sensu/http-checks:0.7.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The Envoy Metrics integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Get the Envoy endpoint target URL. You will need these target URL elements to install this integration:

   - Protocol (`http` or `https`)
   - Host (hostname, IP address, or domain name)
   - Port number (Envoy's default is `9901`)
   - Path (`/stats/prometheus`)

1. Decide which Sensu agents should execute the `envoy-metrics` check. You will need the agent [subscription] names when you install this integration.

1. If you want to use a Sensu [pipeline] to process Envoy Metrics integration data, you will need the pipeline names when you install this integration.

### Disable redirect warnings

The Envoy Metrics integration supports disabling redirect warnings.

To disable redirect warnings, install this integration.
Then, update the `envoy-metrics` check to add the `--redirect-ok` flag in the check's `command` attribute.

**Example**:

```yaml
spec:
 command: >-
   http-get
   --timeout 10
   --redirect-ok
   --url "http://127.0.0.1:9901/stats/prometheus"
```

### Custom request headers

The Envoy Metrics integration supports custom request headers.

To use custom request headers, install this integration.
Then, update the `envoy-metrics` check to add one or more `--header` flags in the check's `command` attribute.

**Example**:

```yaml
spec:
  command: >-
    http-get
    --timeout 10
    --url "http://127.0.0.1:9901/stats/prometheus"
    --header "Content-Type: text/plain"
    --header "X-Example-Header: helloworld"
```

### Token substitution

The Envoy Metrics integration supports Sensu [tokens] for variable substitution with data from Sensu entities.

**envoy_server_live** (Boolean)

Generates a CRITICAL event if the Envoy server is not in a `LIVE` state (`1`).

**envoy_server_state** (gauge)

Generates a CRITICAL event if the current state of the Envoy server is not in a `LIVE` state (`1`).

**envoy_server_days_until_first_cert_expiring** (gauge)

- Generates a WARNING event if 15 or fewer days remain until the first certificate expires.
- Generates a CRITICAL event if 7 or fewer days remain until the first certificate expires.
