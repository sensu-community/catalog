## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Elasticsearch Events integration provides a pipeline for sending metrics and events from Sensu to Elasticsearch.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following resources:

* `elasticsearch` [pipeline]
* `elasticsearch-events` [handler]
* `sensu/sensu-elasticsearch-handler:0.3.2` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

There are no compatible dashboards for this integration.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Per-host Elasticsearch index configuration

   Configure the `sensu.io/plugins/sensu-elasticsearch-handler/config/index` on a per-entity basis to override the default index as configured by the Handler.

   Example `agent.yml` excerpt:

   ```yaml
   annotations:
     sensu.io/plugins/sensu-elasticsearch-handler/config/index: "example_index"
   ```

## Plugins

## Metrics & Events

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

This integration does not produce any [metrics].

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

<!-- This integration provides an alert & incident management processing pipeline for use with other monitoring integrations. By default this integration will process all events passing the [built-in `is_incident` filter][is_incident] (i.e. failing events and resolution events only). Event processing via this integration may be suppressed using [Sensu Silencing][silences] (see the [built-in `not_silenced` filter][not_silenced] for more details). -->

This integration does not produce any events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline].
