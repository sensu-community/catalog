        In order to provide the best experience installing integrations
        from the catalog, we have embedded all credentials directly in the installed Sensu
        Resources. This means that all sensu users with read access to the cluster will be
        able to see these resources and embedded credentials in plain text. Resources are also
        very likely to be stored unencrypted at rest in the Sensu store.

        We recommend that you consider migrating these secrets to a supported
        [secrets store](https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/operations/manage-secrets/secrets-management/).
