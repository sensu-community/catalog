## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The [AWS RDS] integration collects RDS metrics from [AWS CloudWatch], and alerts on various Lamda conditions.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following resources:

* [AWS RDS]: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/
* [AWS CloudWatch]: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/


## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

There are no compatible dashboards for this integration.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->
1. This integration requires access to AWS CloudWatch APIs.

   All forms of AWS authentication supported by the [AWS CLI] are supported, including [EC2 IAM Instance Profiles]. This integration requires read-only access to AWS CloudWatch (e.g. `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess`).

   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secret(s) or environment variable(s) are not needed if the check(s) from this integration are run on a `sensu-agent` installed on an EC2 instance with an IAM Instance Profile containing the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess`.

## Metrics & Events

This integration collects several [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon RDS] (i.e. `AWS/RDS` metrics).
Please refer to the [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon RDS] reference documentation for descriptions of each metric.

| `aws_rds_cpu_utilization_average` | The average percentage of CPU utilization during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_cpu_utilization_maximum` | The minimum percentage of CPU utilization during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_cpu_utilization_minimum` | The minimum percentage of CPU utilization during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_freeable_memory_average` | The average bytes of available random access memory during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_freeable_memory_maximum` | The minimum bytes of available random access memory during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_freeable_memory_minimum` | The minimum bytes of available random access memory during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_free_strorage_space_average` | The average bytes of available storage space during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_free_strorage_space_maximum` | The minimum bytes of available storage space during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |
| `aws_rds_free_strorage_space_minimum` | The minimum bytes of available storage space during the time period. | DBInstanceIdentifier, DatabaseClass, EngineName, SourceRegion |

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

This integration produces the following events which should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline]:

* `cpu_utilization WARNING`

Produces a warning when CPU utilization is over a warning threshold (default: 80%)
* `cpu_utilization CRITICAL`
Produces a warning when CPU utilization is over a critical threshold (default: 90%)
